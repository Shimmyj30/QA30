        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Hi! I'm excited to share my passions for basketball and salsa dancing with you.<br>
            I always try to keep a good Body-Mind Connection. <br>
             Basketball and Salsa help me maintain 
            that healthy relationship between the two <br> and maintain a good sense of well-being to my weekly routine.

        <h2>Basketball</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Basketball has always been my favorite sport. I love the thrill of the game, the teamwork, and the energy it brings.  Basketball has profoundly shaped my life since I picked it up in 4th grade. It taught me discipline, teamwork, and resilience, helping me grow both on and off the court. Every game and practice became a chance to challenge myself, build friendships, and develop a healthy, goal-oriented mindset that continues to benefit me to this day.</p>

        <h2>Salsa</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Salsa dancing became my unexpected favorite hobby in my late 20s, adding an exciting and joyful dimension to my life. What started as a casual attempt to try something new quickly turned into a passion. The rhythm, energy, and sense of connection on the dance floor captivated me, offering a fun escape from routine while keeping me active. Beyond the physical benefits, salsa introduced me to a vibrant community and a newfound confidence, making it an irreplaceable part of my life.</p>
